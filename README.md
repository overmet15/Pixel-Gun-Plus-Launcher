# Pixel Gun Plus Launcher

As of Febuary 1 2025 this launcher is confirmed by Plus Team.

## Why?
- Some people (including me) had issues with official launcher, it did not work, for some people it didnt launch, for me it crashes game... So, i made my own launcher on unity, since PGP is made on Unity, there should be no problems. Official launcher also didnt really care where to save game... so.. it save it in appdata folder, which in most (if not all) cases is located on main drive, which is not really good for some people.
This launcher saves game in launcher folder, which makes you able to choose where you want game to be stored (kinda).

Notice that this launcher has been rushed and not planned to be public, many things will change in feature.

If you want, you can fork the launcher and/or make custom version of it.
